# Put File

## Installation

- Assumes `ripgrep` (`rg`) is installed.

## Usage

1. Bring up command palette: Cmd+Shift+P
2. Type "Put file path here"
3. Type to search for a filename
4. Select a file to put the path at the current location

## Rationale

While writing books, I find it helpful to type out file paths multiple times. To ensure I type out file paths consistently correctly without mistakes, I'm using this extension.
